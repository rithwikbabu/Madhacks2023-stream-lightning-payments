# Algorithm Explanation
st.markdown("---")
st.markdown("## THE ALGORITHM")
st.markdown("""
Our backend, powered by `graph_simulator.py`, employs `networkx` and `hedera` for graph and blockchain interactions respectively.

**Highlights:**
- **Hedera Test Network Integration:** Provides a safe and cost-effective environment for transaction simulations.
- **Graph-Based Simulations:** Facilitates realistic transaction pathfinding using the Hedera cryptocurrency API.

**Caveats:**
- Blockchain operations are dependent on test network availability and may have different performance metrics compared to the mainnet.

# Hedera Implementation
st.markdown("---")
st.markdown("## Hedera Implementation")
st.markdown("""
Our software utilizes the Hedera test network to simulate real-world transactions with the Hedera cryptocurrency API.

**Hedera Test Network Features:**
- Access to a pre-configured environment for development and testing.
- Simulated account creation and HBAR transfers to test transactions without real-world costs.
- Real-time feedback on transaction status and performance for optimization.

**Note:** Transactions on the Hedera test network use test HBARs and have no real-world value, allowing for risk-free testing.

# Verbal Runtime Analysis
st.markdown("---")
st.markdown("## Runtime Analysis")
st.markdown("""
While actual performance metrics are subject to several factors, indicative analysis on the Hedera test network is as follows:

- **Initialization:** Sub-second setup for the Hedera client.
- **Account Creation:** Ranges between 100-200ms on the Hedera test network.
- **Transaction Execution:** Typically takes 500-1000ms, depending on network conditions and transaction complexity.

These metrics are illustrative for the Hedera test network and may vary based on actual network conditions.
